# Texta-AI
I made this for fun, with the purpose of trying to better understand data science and AI. It's dedicated for open-sourced AI community.
Don't hestitate to edit whole code, as it's acceptable.

This project is on early stages of development as more people discover this page and contribute it'll be better.




# About project
Unlike most Ai projects on github this project doesn't use 3.rd party python packages. 

# Contribution tips
Try to add new feature, optimize, discuss, try to imrprove this code overall. With right pull request I probably may accept it.

# To run
If you wanna fine tune this model change text file. You need to edit src.py code for that tho.
